# BleTest

A Simple Chat app implemented using BLE.  
Kind of pointless since the short range means people can just talk to each other directly.  
Pretty easy to modify to transmit data but BLE means it's gonna be slow. 
Device 1 opens the server and Devices 2 to N connect to the server as clients to join the group chat.  
Clients discover the server via BLE scanning or reading a QR with the server's BLE address.
